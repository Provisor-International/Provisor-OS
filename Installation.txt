Installation of Provisor/OS:
****************************

Provisor/OS comes as 2_Drives hdf-image including a boot-able Provisor/OS and POOL:Boot.rom on SmartFilesystem.
Stored at DDrive<version>:Provisor-OS_<version>.tar you find the standard filesystem as tar-archive.
The tar-archive is intended as Installation-archive for bringing Provisor/OS to a new media/drive.

Installation steps:
*******************

Configure/Setup with a Amiga/Compatible System or Emulator the new drive(s) with SYS:System/HdToolBox, boot-able comes at the end of the install-process.
Set the drive(s) for the use of SmartFilesystem by adding SFS as Filesystem and change the drive(s) to SFS - mostly adding and then change to CFS0.
Mostly after a reboot the new drive(s) are visible as unformated on the Desktop, now format the drive(s) like every time, or in the shell with sfsformat.
Open (V)Shell and switch to the new drive which will contain the OS in future and do "tar xvfp <Drive>:Provisor-OS_<version>.tar".
This creates at the drive the OS-Structure and data. By finished tar command, Provisor/OS is ready after setting the new Provisor/OS-Drive boot-able.
Set it boot-able by use HdToolBox again and boot from the new drive. Hint: By change another settings in HdToolBox at the end this can destroy the installation.
